DeepaMehta 3 Accounts Plugin
============================

Restricts access to DeepaMehta 3 by putting a login dialog at application start.
Accounts can be created and modified by the user. One account is pre-configured.

Note: there is no access control mechanism with individual permissions yet.
This plugin just restricts a DeepaMehta 3 installation to a set of well-known users.
Each user, once logged in, has access to everything.
